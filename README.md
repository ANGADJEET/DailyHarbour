# Ecommerce Application

This repository contains an end-to-end ecommerce application developed using Python and Flask for the backend, and vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application focuses on robust DBMS and SQL integration, ensuring a high-performing and scalable database through the use of query optimization and transaction control principles.

## Features

- **Backend**: Developed using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **Frontend**: Created with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **AJAX**: Implemented for seamless asynchronous communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Database Management**: Utilized SQL for robust database integration, with a focus on query optimization and transaction control to maintain performance and scalability.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- A SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-app.git
cd ecommerce-app
```

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Setup

1. Create a SQL database.
2. Update the database configuration in the `config.py` file.

```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/dbname'
```

3. Initialize the database.

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

## Running the Application

```bash
flask run
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Key Principles

### Query Optimization

To ensure efficient database operations, various query optimization techniques were implemented, such as indexing, query caching, and careful query construction to minimize execution time and resource consumption.

### Transaction Control

Transaction control mechanisms were used to maintain data integrity and consistency, particularly during critical operations such as order processing, payments, and inventory updates. This includes the use of commit and rollback operations to handle errors gracefully.
